# createFASTAfiles
Create fasta files from DArTseq data

THIS SCRIPT CAN CREATE FASTA FILES FROM YOUR DARTSEQ DATA

REQUIREMENTS

PHYTON V3.6.4 OR RECENT
REQUIRES PYTHON MODULES: sys, getopt

HANDLES

#-i PATH TO YOUR INPUT FILE AS A .csv DOCUMENT
#-o PATH TO YOUR OUTPUT FILE (NOTE: THE FILE DOES NOT HAVE TO EXIST, THE PROGRAM WILL CREATE THE FILE, JUST GIVE IT A NAME AND ADD THE TERMINATION AS .txt or .csv or .fasta
#-u ROW WHERE DATA STARTS. FOR DARTSEQ DATA IT IS USUALY 11. START COUNTING FROM 0.
# -s COLUMN WITH UNIQUE IDENTIFIER NUMBER OR "seqIndex". DARTSEQ DATA DOES NOT INCLUDE A SEQ INDEX, HOWEVER YOU CAN USE THE TARGET ID COLUMN CONSIDERING THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE REPS, IF YOU HAVE REPS YOU NEED TO GIVE THEM UNIQUE NUMBERS BEFORE YOU CREATE YOUR FASTA FILE. START COUNTING FROM 0.
# -t COLUMN WITH TRIMMED SEQUENCE IN DARTSEQ DATA "trimmedSeq". START COUNTING FROM 0


EXAMPLE OF COMMANDLINE TO CREATE YOUR FASTA FILES

TO RUN THE CODE, MOVE DIRECTORIES TO THE LOCATION WHERE YOU SAVED THIS SCRIPT, AND RUN THE COMMAND IN THE COMMANDLINE. 

MakeFastaFiles_nonHardCode.py -i PATH\YOUR_FILE.CSV -o PATH\YOUR_NEW_FILE.CSV -u 6 -s 0 -t 2

NOTES FOR COMMON PROBLEMS: 
*IF YOU ARE RUNNING THIS CODE IN WINDOWS. THE PATH FILE NEEDS A DOUBLE BACKSLASH TO RUN THE READ INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES
EXAMPLE: C:\\Users\MHS\Documents\998897.csv

*CHECK THAT THE PATH TO YOUR FILE DOES NOT HAVE SPACES BETWEEN NAMES LIKE C:\\Program files\Python\scripts\fasta.py
SOME TIMES YOU CAN ESCAPE THE SPACES BY ADDIND "" AT THE BEGGINING AND END OF THE PATH. I RATHER TO JUST RELOCATE THE FILE IN A DIRECTORY WTIHOUT SPACES.
